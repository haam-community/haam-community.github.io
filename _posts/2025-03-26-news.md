As with other ISBA-affiliated communities we will be moving away from Slack to Element (Matrix).

You can find our HAAM space [here](https://app.element.io/#/room/#haam-community:archaeo.social).

Please, follow this [link](https://www.isbarch.org/chat) for more information and instructions on how to join.

Our Slack will be archived starting the 1st of April. 

Please contact us if you have any problems in accessing the new platform.

See you there!
