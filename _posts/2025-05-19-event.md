***Abstract:

With the increasing accessibility of genetic data from both ancient and present-day populations, research in human history and ancestry has never been more dynamic. However, the ethical challenges surrounding this work remain complex. From questions of informed consent and data sovereignty to the socio-political implications of genetic narratives, researchers must navigate a landscape where science intersects with identity, history, and cultural heritage.

Therefore, the [HAAM-Radio organisation team](https://haam-community.github.io/projects/haam_radio/) together with [Epifanía Arango Isaza](https://haam-community.github.io/news/2024/08/19/news/) brings experts from diverse backgrounds to discuss the ethical dimensions of ancient DNA and population genetics research. Through short, engaging talks (10-15 minutes), speakers will address topics such as community engagement, Indigenous perspectives, data ownership, and researchers' responsibilities in communicating their findings.

Following these presentations, an open discussion invites participants to reflect critically, share experiences, and explore pathways for more ethical and inclusive research practices. By amplifying underrepresented voices and fostering dialogue, we aim to shape a research approach that is both rigorous and socially responsible.
