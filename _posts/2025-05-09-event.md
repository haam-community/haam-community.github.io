Gathering metadata or finding samples and data based on metadata for a project can be a real challenge, but so can uploading the metadata in the first place! Anyone who has ever uploaded sequencing data to public repositories or aggregated data for a project knows what a nightmare it can be!
The [_**M**inimum **In**formation about any **A**ncient **S**equence (MInAS)_](https://www.mixs-minas.org/) project aims to develop standardised and dedicated metadata reporting schemes for ancient DNA samples and sequencing data via community-based consensus and training. But in order to develop these schemes we need as much community input as possible. We are a diverse research community and you will be the end-user.

In this extraordinary HAAM-Radio, we will give [**Thiseas C. Lamnidis**](https://www.eva.mpg.de/archaeogenetics/staff/thiseas-christos-lamnidis/) and [**James Fellows Yates**](https://www.jafy.eu/) the stage to introduce the project and ask you to get your hands dirty! During this roundtable, they will introduce the project, ask you to try filling out the draft MInAS metadata checklist they have been developing and then ask you to give feedback on your experiences. This is your chance to provide input, get YOUR perspectives and contributions to making a field-wide reporting standard, and make sure the standards also fit YOUR research!
