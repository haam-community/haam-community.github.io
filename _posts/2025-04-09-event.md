For our HAAM-Meeting, we plan to have
 - a career panel discussion with invited speakers at different career levels (Postdocs, Junior PIs, people who moved fields or changed career paths)
 - and we want to give people, who were selected for a poster presentation, but *not* flash talk, the opportunity to present their posters in a 1-2 min flash talk in the end of our meeting. 

Please submit your expression [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfvdlLdjUC3OCymuU2stOPvZo69_IFYJc_SHq0Ht5kerXfk-g/viewform?usp=dialog).

#### Deadline: 15th of June 2025.

#### The flash talks will be performed in person and not be recorded.
