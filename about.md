We are an international and open community of researchers interested in studying human population history, ancestry, and mobility through ancient DNA.

Our main goal is the open exchange of knowledge for the betterment of the field, and to work together to overcome common challenges of human aDNA research.
In the future, we plan to organise training workshops, as well as collaborative projects to benefit the entire community.

Please join us on our:

- [**slack channel**](https://join.slack.com/t/haam-community/shared_invite/zt-1xoeh4d42-ZzuAWVTyQpKoFmuezBTdMA)
for day-to-day advice, help, brainstorming, news, networking, and socialising.

If we are not the community you are looking for, check out other [ISBA-related communities](https://www.isbarch.org/affiliations-and-initiatives) working with ancient biomolecules or related research questions:

- [Animal aDNA Research Community (AaRC)](https://www.animal-adna.org/about/): a community that aims to bring together early career researchers applying genomic approaches to ancient animal remains and nucleotide-preserving material. 

- [Lipid Analysis for Archaeological Research Development (LAARD) Community](https://laardcommunity.github.io/about/): a community of international researchers focused on the analysis of ancient lipids resulting from human activities. LAARD’s goal is to cultivate spaces for open and cooperative science to overcome common challenges in the field.

- [Palaeoproteomics And Archaeology, Society for Techniques and Advances (PAASTA) Community](https://paasta-community.github.io/about/): An ECR-led community of researchers working with palaeoproteomics, the study of ancient proteins. An open and supportive environment committed to promoting and facilitating collaborative and open science!

- [Standards, Precautions, and Advances in Ancient Metagenomics (SPAAM) Community](https://www.spaam-community.org/about/): a community of researchers focusing on ancient metagenomics. SPAAM supports open science initiatives to find solutions to common challenges and obstacles in the field. SPAAM sponsors collaborative projects, summer schools, a Slack channel, and a yearly workshop.
