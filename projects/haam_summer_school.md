# Information

In line with the goals of the HAAM community to advance the field of human population genetics and ancient DNA (aDNA) through open collaboration and knowledge sharing, we are organising the second annual HAAM Summer School to share the latest methodologies in human aDNA research through online hands-on workshops by leading experts in the field.

The Summer School will be held in a 100% virtual format to maximise accessibility and inclusivity for attendees worldwide, particularly for those working in lower-income countries and/or with limited funding. There will be a limited number of attendee positions.

The programme will include both theoretical and practical sessions. The exact schedule is still to be confirmed, but over the course of three days, students will be given a dedicated introduction to:
- working with human archaeological remains, 
- the ethics involved with working with human remains,
- the main challenges and features of aDNA sequencing data processing,
- how to curate archaeogenetic data,
- how to perform analyses of genetic relatedness, and population history

# Acknowledgments

This year’s course is planned by active researchers of the HAAM-community (including **The Francis Crick Institute (UK)**, **MPI-EVA (DE)**, **University of Lausanne (CH)** & **University of Wisconsin (USA)**. Instructors of the course are volunteers teaching during the period of the summer school. The summer school is supported by Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, [Adelphi Genetics Forum](https://adelphigenetics.org/) and the [International Society of Biomolecular Archaeology](https://www.isbarch.org/) .
