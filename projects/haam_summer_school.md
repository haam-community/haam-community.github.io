In line with the goals of the HAAM community to advance the field of human population genetics and ancient DNA (aDNA) through open collaboration and knowledge sharing, we are organising the first annual HAAM Summer School to share the latest methodologies in human aDNA research through online hands-on workshops by leading experts in the field.

The Summer School will be held in a 100% virtual format to maximise accessibility and inclusivity for attendees worldwide, particularly for those working in lower-income countries and/or with limited funding. There will be a limited number of attendee positions.

The programme will include both theoretical and practical sessions. The exact schedule is still to be confirmed, but over the course of three days, students will be given a dedicated to introduction to:
- working with human archaeological remains, 
- the ethics involved with working with human remains,
- the main challenges and features of aDNA sequencing data processing,
- how to curate archaeogenetic data,
- how to perform analyses of genetic relatedness, and population history

The students will work on a real (published) dataset, processing it from raw sequencing reads to genotypes.
For practical sessions focused on specific tools or software, we invited the developers of said tools whenever possible to lead the workshops, in order to optimise the learning experience.

At the end of each day we will host a round table, where attendees will have the opportunity to ask specific questions about their own datasets or to discuss any topics in more detail.

We aim to approach gender parity amongst the instructors as much as possible, with five female and six male instructors invited, affiliated to institutions across Europe, the USA, and Turkey and representing a wide variety of career stages (PhD students, postdocs and group leaders). At the time of submission of this proposal we have gotten confirmation from six instructors: James Fellows Yates, Selina Carlhoff, Harald Ringbauer, Stephan Schiffels, Robert Maier and Sevval Akturk. 

Dates: June/July 2024 (TBC!)

⭐️ Applications will open soon! ⭐️
